# Akasio (Golang)

Akasio is a simple HTTP server that redirects traffic based on a JSON redirect table.

## Usages

This section covers the basic usages for Akasio.

### Redirect Table

Akasio redirects incoming requests based on what's called a "redirect table". This table is essentially a JSON file with a simple source-to-target mapping. You can find an example `akasio.json` under the `configs` directory.

```json
{
    "/": "http://k4yt3x.com/akasio-go/",
    "/g": "https://www.google.com",
    "/k4yt3x": "https://k4yt3x.com"
}
```

This example redirect table does the following mappings:

- `/` to http://k4yt3x.com/akasio-go/
- `/g` to https://www.google.com
- `/k4yt3x` to https://k4yt3x.com

Taking the `/g` mapping for example, when a user visits `https://yourwebsite.com/g`, the user will be redirected to https://www.google.com via a HTTP 301 (moved permanently) response.

### Website Setup

The recommended setup is to start Akasio as a service behind reverse proxy web server like Apache, Nginx or Caddy.

You can find an example service file at `configs/akasio.service`. To install Akasio as a service, do the following.

1. Build the `akasio` binary or download the `akasio` binary from [releases](https://github.com/k4yt3x/akasio-go/releases) (**TBD**).
1. Move the `akasio` binary to `/usr/local/bin/akasio`.
1. Move the service file to `/etc/systemd/system/akasio.service`.
1. Reload systemd with `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. Enable and start the service with `systemctl enable --now akasio`.
1. Verify that the service has been started successfully via `curl -v 127.0.0.1:8000`.
1. Configure front-end web server to reverse proxy to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Binary Usages

The binary's usage is as following. You can also invoke `akasio -h` to see the usages.

```console
Usages:
  -b string
        binding address (IP:port) (default "127.0.0.1:8080")
  -d    enable debugging mode, which disables security checks
  -n string
        server hostname (default "akas.io")
  -r string
        redirect table path (default "/etc/akasio.json")
```

## Building From Source

The following commands will build Akasio binary at `bin/akasio`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/k4yt3x/akasio-go.git
cd akasio-go
make
```

After building, you may also use `make install` to install `akasio` to `/usr/local/bin/akasio`.
